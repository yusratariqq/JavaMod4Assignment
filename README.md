Java Annotations and Maven Assignment
Java Annotations and Its Types:

Annotations in Java provide metadata for code. They can influence compiler behavior or runtime processing. Built-in annotations include @Override, @Deprecated, and @SuppressWarnings. @Override ensures a method overrides a superclass method, while @Deprecated marks a method as obsolete. @SuppressWarnings ignores compiler warnings.

Meta-annotations define annotation behavior. Common meta-annotations are @Retention, @Target, @Documented, and @Inherited. Retention policies determine how long annotations are kept: SOURCE, CLASS, and RUNTIME. Annotations can affect runtime behavior using reflection.

Custom annotations are created using @interface. The @Target meta-annotation restricts applicable elements. Default values can be defined for annotation methods. Marker annotations have no methods, single-value annotations have one method. Repeatable annotations allow multiple uses on a single element. Annotations integrate with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate and can sometimes be inherited using @Inherited.
